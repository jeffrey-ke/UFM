    <em>UFM unifies the tasks of Optical Flow Estimation and Wide Baseline Matching and provides accurate dense correspondences for in-the-wild images at significantly fast inference speeds.</em>
</p>

## Welcome to the Training Branch
If you reach here, you are interested in building upon UFM, thank you for your effort contributing to generalizable correspondence prediction!

This branch contains the data downloading and processing instructions, example and full training scripts used to create UFM.

## ✅ Data Processing Is Ready

We have completed cleaning the data processing, all data should be ready. Please let us know if something does not work.

## Updates
- [2025/10/26] Complete data source and processing scripts.
- [2025/10/21] Complete training and most data processing scripts.
- [2025/10/20] Benchmark & data script for primary results.
- [2025/10/08] Released 980 resolution models.
- [2025/06/10] Initial release of model checkpoint and inference code.

## What's Included

- **Data downloading and processing scripts** for recreate entire UFM data.
- **Example and complete training code** for recreating UFM training.
- **Logging and visualization support** to monitor training.

## Getting Started
### Setup Environment

This branch is a [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) project. Create the environment with:

```bash
uv sync                 # inference + training stack; add --extra dev for lint/test tools
```

`uniception` is installed automatically from its pinned git commit, so `git submodule update --init`
is **not** required (the submodule remains only if you want the source on disk). Run tools inside the
environment with `uv run` (e.g. `uv run ufm test`, `uv run python scripts/train.py ...`) or activate it
with `source .venv/bin/activate`.


### Setup Data

Please refer to `preprocess_datasets/README.md` for a complete guide. We provided preprocessed blendedmvs dataset for running the example training scripts.

### Setup Configuration

You need to setup data paths for your machine. please modify `configs/machine/your_machine.yaml` to another name and modify `root_data_dir` to point to the root folder of all `*_processed` folders. 

The `machines` configuration allows the same code to run on multiple places seamlessly. You can see how they work at the top of the example training scripts. 

### Example Training

Modify the logic for setting the `machine` environment variable in the file, and run: 

```bash
bash bash_scripts/examples/blendedmvs.sh
```
